      spacing: 100,
      baseDotSize: 3,
    },
    shapes: {
      primary: {
        type: ShapeType.FLOWER_OF_LIFE,
        size: 400,
        opacity: 0.8,
      }
    }
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100%', height: '100vh' }}>
      <SacredGrid initialSettings={customSettings} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
